Repo for our (Vihan Nunkoo, Kurt Richardson, Joshua Olliver-Cole, Jay Ragoo) ADPROC coursework, a box ordering system...
[Specification](ADPROC-spec.pdf)

## Improvements to be added after demo:
- Further input validation for overloading values
- Check the method for which prices are calculated
- Quantity input component as a 'spinner'
- Give user dimension units options (?)
- Try to sanitize against text taken as float in dimension input.
